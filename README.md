# Artificial-Intelligence
I am taking the Artifical Intelligence graduate course taught by Dr. Dylan Shell at Texas A&M University, College Station in Spring 2016. Initially this repository is meant for the Programming Assignments I got as part of the course. We usually get open-ended problems which we attempt to solve by applying the principles and techniques of the field of Artificial Intelligence. 

Artificial Intelligence is a vast field with many applications. Hopefully, I will continue to explore the field and write good code for solving various tasks in the domain.
